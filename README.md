# iPod Classic Mods
My attempt at modernizing the iPod Classic (6th generation) includes the following:

- [USB-C Mod](https://github.com/maxmacstn/iPod-Classic-6-mods/tree/main/Mods/USB-C) – Converts the 30-pin dock connector to a USB-C interface.

- [Bluetooth Audio Mod](ESP32-Bluetooth-Audio – Enables audio transmission to headphones or speakers via Bluetooth, with playback control.

- Taptic Engine – Replaces the clicking sound (from the buzzer) with haptic feedback. There are a bunch of videos out there on how to do this mod, so I haven’t included it in this repo. I used a Taptic Engine from an iPhone 11 Plus. It's small and provides a nice, firm vibration.
